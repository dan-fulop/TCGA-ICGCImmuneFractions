# TCGA-ICGCImmuneFractions
R files to generate immune cell fractions from TCGA and ICGC cancer samples using previously published bulk RNA-seq deconvolution methods in the "immunedeconv" package (see https://icbi-lab.github.io/immunedeconv/). Can be used to compare immune cell type proportions within and between samples (depending on specific method used). Functions contained within ImmuneCellFractions_TCGA_ICGC.R can be used to transform TCGA and ICGC data into the appropriate format for use by immunedeconv functions as well as to perform deconvolutions and map data to a common cell vocabulary for easy comparison. Code is commented, but please feel free to reach out with any questions.
